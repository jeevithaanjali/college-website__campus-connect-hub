        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Quaid-E-Millath Government College for Women has its roots in the Madrasa founded by the last Nawab of Carnatic, Ghulam Ghouse Khan Bahadur in the middle of the 18th century. In 1901, the Government purchased Umdah Bagh, the present campus, and elevated the Madrasa to the status of a College which was called the Mohameddan Arts College. The main building (which stands even today) was opened on 29th November 1934 by Lord Erskine, the then Governor of Madras.</p>
         <p>From 1938, the College admitted non-Muslims to the extent of 25 per cent. During the academic year 1948-49, the institution was renamed as Government Arts College and admission was thrown open to all. In 1974, it was renamed yet again by the Government of Tamil Nadu as Quaid-E-Millath Government College for Women in honour of the prominent freedom fighter and philanthropist, Janab Ibrahim Sahib who is popularly known as Quaid-E-Millath. At that time, the college offered five Undergraduate Courses and a few hundred students were enrolled. The College is located in a sprawling 30 acres campus and still retains many of the old colonial style buildings and a vast playground.</p>
